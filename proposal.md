# Capstone Proposal

## Name
### Knock It Back

## Overview
Knock It Back aims to provide an updatable database for users to search/find alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Results will be rendered by a category selection (alcoholic versus non-alcoholic), alcohol type (gin, rum, vodka, etc.), and/or keyword search (part of a name or an ingredient). Beverage listings will include relevent information such as the name, a photo if available, ingredients and measurements, and directions on how to make.

This project is pulling primarily from TheCocktailDB.com API: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
